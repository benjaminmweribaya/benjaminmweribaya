👋 Hi there! I'm Benjamin Mweri Baya

As a Chemical and Process Engineer, my passion for solving complex problems has naturally extended into the world of software development. Engineering, at its core, is about optimization, efficiency, and innovation—skills that translate seamlessly into the tech industry. I believe that the fusion of engineering principles and coding can create transformative solutions, not only in chemical processes but across industries.

👀 What I’m interested in
I am dedicated to building a career that drives sustainable innovation and positive change. By combining my engineering expertise with software development, I aim to develop solutions that address global challenges in environmental conservation, process optimization, and community empowerment.

🌱 Current Journey
Currently, I’m diving deeper into software engineering through FreeCodeCamp while expanding my knowledge in full-stack software development at Moringa School. My goal is to harness the power of technology to create tools that optimize processes, enhance sustainability, and bring efficiency to various fields, including chemical engineering.

💡 How Coding Connects to Engineering
Chemical and process engineering is all about designing and managing systems that transform raw materials into useful products. Coding, on the other hand, allows us to automate, analyze, and optimize these systems in a more efficient and scalable way. Whether it's creating algorithms to simulate chemical processes, or developing software to control manufacturing operations, coding enables me to take my engineering skills to the next level.

💞️ Collaboration Interests
I'm eager to collaborate on projects that:
- Address societal issues
- Promote environmental sustainability
- Empower communities through tech-driven solutions
